# volunteerstage

- Our idea is to make a platform to find Nonprofit Organizations/NGO’s to contribute to according to tags.
Working – The platform will be of three parts – 
For the Volunteer- 
The volunteer could search for a non-profit organization based on his interest.  example. education, child-traffic, food, women empowerment etc.  
They could search for the duration of engagement and their location. 
There shall be an option to contribute through monetary funds also.

For the organizations –
The organizations could get the volunteer’s applications and can be contacted through the medium/portal. 
The website will provide details of different NGOs to the registered volunteers. 
NGOs will provide their requirement for the volunteers and any volunteer who is willing to join can register to the NGO page.

ADVANTAGES:
Helpful for Volunteers to find Organisation to work with and contribute in welfare of society.
Organisations can take applications easily through the portal and display information at one place.
Save volunteer’s time searching.
